I am an avid traveler. Whenever I have money and time, I just pack my bags and hit the road preferably with my friends. I am also a huge fan of the Real Madrid Football Club, Rafael Nadal (Tennis player), and Luka Dončić (Basketball player of the NBA team- Dallas Mavericks). During my leisure time, I enjoy reading books, listening to music on Spotify, and watching travel vlogs.
